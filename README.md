# Predicting flight delays using weather data
This project isn't even remotely finished yet

The end goal is to predict how delayed flights will be based on weather conditions at their departure airport.
Predicting delayed landings based on weather at the destination airport could be done too since that's also included in the dataset I'm using.

## Data Sources
For flight delays I'm using this dataset from the U.S. Department of Transportation:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/  
For weather data I doubt there are any premade data sets meeting my exact needs, so I'll likely use some historical weather API such as this one:
